# NSAway

### Work In Progress.

![nsaway](icons/nsaway.png)

NSAway is a Military-GradeÂ® Snooper Detection System (last generation IDS).

I'm kidding, It's just a daemon that listen for some (suspicious) event.

The name comes from NSA-Away (keep the NSA away from your PC) or from NSA-Way (do things the NSA way, Paranoid mode On).

### Why?
If you are **Edward Snowden** or **Mr.Robot** this script won't help you.<br/>
Go fry your PC!

Otherwise this program can be useful if:
 - You are Paranoid
 - You think that you will be Pwn3d (Hacked)
 - You are in an insecure network

**And you want to detect suspicious behavior**
