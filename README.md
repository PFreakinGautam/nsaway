# NSAway

### Work In Progress.

![nsaway](icons/nsaway.png)

NSAway is a Military-GradeÂ® Snooper Detection System (last generation IDS).

I'm kidding, It's just a daemon that listens for some (suspicious) events.

The name comes from NSA-Away (keep the NSA away from your PC) or from NSA-Way (do things the NSA way, Paranoid mode On).

### Why?
If you are **Edward Snowden** or **Mr.Robot** this script won't help you.<br/>
Go fry your PC!

Otherwise this program can be useful if:
 - You are Paranoid
 - You think that you will be Pwn3d (Hacked)
 - You are in an insecure network

**And you want to detect suspicious behavior**

### Installation (only on GNU/Linux)

#### On Desktop

##### Dependency
Make sure you have a GUI interface for sudo (**gksudo** on ArchLinux or **pkexec** on Fedora, Ubuntu have both)

    $ which gksudo && which pkexec

Install ZeroMQ Python bindings without

    $ pip install pyzmq

**Optional** if you want the GUI interface

    $ pip install pyqt4

Make sure you have installed "*notify-send*" and your user can send notify.

    $ notify-send "Hello World, who is listening?"

##### Installation

Download a .deb package *(not available)* or Clone this repo and run **setup.py**

    $ git clone https://github.com/TheZ3ro/nsaway
    $ sudo python setup.py install

### Feature

The IDS is based on Plugins.
Plugins are called on every interval (default: 3.0 seconds) and they can do various tasks or checks on the System.
You can select the plugin list to load in the **/etc/nsaway.ini** file.

#### Plugins

 - video.py:  Check if a /dev/video device is used
 - audio.py:  Check if one of the Audio-Capture-Device is used
 - arp_poison.py:  Check if the MAC address of default Gateway changes
 - sslstrip.py:  Check if there are changes on the page of 2 or more trusted website
 - sslmitm.py:  Check Fingerprint changes of 2 or more trusted website
